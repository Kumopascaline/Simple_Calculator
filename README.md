# A SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING QT FOR C++


The Calculator: This calculator is made up of two modes,which is the Simple mode or Elimentary mode and Engineering mode. The Windows title changes depending on the mode of the calculator

Elementary Mode: When clicked on elementary mode the window’s title changes to Normal.

In the simple mode, the user can perform simple  operations like, addition, subtraction,multiplication,division,square root and inverse of a number. This mode also permits you to add,subtract,multiply and divide and perform order simple operations on decimal numbers.
Engineering Mode: When the moused is clicked on engineering mode, the windows title changes to Engineering.

The engineering mode is made up of the simple mode but with additional functionalities. With these mode we can perform trigonometric functions like sin,tan,cos and tan. We can also find the hyperbolic cosine function(cosh),the hyperbolic sine function(sinh) and the hyperbolic tangent funtion(tanh). We can also perform factorial of a number(n!) and also the log and In of a number.
